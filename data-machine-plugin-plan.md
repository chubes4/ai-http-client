# Data Machine Plugin - Comprehensive Overview

## 1. Introduction

The Data Machine plugin is a powerful WordPress tool designed to automate the entire lifecycle of data: from collection and processing to publishing and distribution. It empowers users to create custom data pipelines, connecting various data sources, transforming the data with AI-powered processing, and publishing the results to diverse destinations. The plugin is built with modularity and extensibility in mind, allowing for easy integration of new data sources, processing techniques, and output methods.

## 2. Core Functionality

### 2.1. Project Management

The plugin allows users to create and manage data collection projects. Each project represents a complete data pipeline, defining the overall data source, processing steps, and output destinations. Projects provide a high-level organizational structure for managing complex data workflows.

### 2.2. Module Management

Within each project, users can define individual modules. Modules represent specific steps in the data pipeline, such as data input, processing, or output. This modular design allows for flexibility and reusability, as modules can be combined and configured to create diverse data workflows.

### 2.3. Data Input Handlers

Data Input Handlers are responsible for collecting data from various sources. The plugin currently supports the following input handlers:

*   **Files:** Imports data from local files, such as CSV, TXT, and JSON files.
*   **RSS Feeds:** Collects data from RSS feeds, allowing for automated content aggregation.
*   **Public REST APIs:** Integrates with public REST APIs to retrieve data from external services.
*   **Social Media:** Connects to social media platforms like Instagram and Reddit to collect user data and content.

### 2.4. Data Processing Engine

The Data Processing Engine is the heart of the plugin, responsible for transforming and enriching the collected data. It leverages AI models (OpenAI) to perform tasks such as:

*   **Data Extraction:** Extracts relevant information from unstructured data.
*   **Data Transformation:** Converts data into a consistent and usable format.
*   **Data Enrichment:** Adds additional information to the data, such as sentiment analysis or topic classification.
*   **Fact Checking:** Verifies the accuracy of the processed data using external fact-checking APIs.

### 2.5. Data Output Handlers

Data Output Handlers are responsible for publishing the processed data to various destinations. The plugin currently supports the following output handlers:

*   **Data Export:** Exports data to various file formats, such as CSV and JSON.
*   **Local WordPress Posts:** Creates new WordPress posts or updates existing posts with the processed data.
*   **Remote APIs:** Sends data to remote APIs for further processing or storage.
*   **Twitter (Potential Future Feature):** Publishes data to Twitter, allowing for automated content sharing and social media engagement.

### 2.6. Scheduling

The Scheduling module automates the data collection and processing workflow using WP Cron. Users can define schedules for projects and modules, specifying how often the data should be collected, processed, and published.

### 2.7. API Key Management

The API Key Management module provides a secure way to store and manage API keys for external services, such as OpenAI and social media platforms. This ensures that sensitive credentials are not exposed in the codebase.

## 3. Architecture and Design

The Data Machine plugin is designed with a modular architecture and a clear separation of concerns. This design promotes:

*   **Maintainability:** Each module is self-contained and can be updated or modified without affecting other parts of the plugin.
*   **Extensibility:** New data sources, processing techniques, and output methods can be easily added by creating new modules.
*   **Testability:** Each module can be tested independently, ensuring the quality and reliability of the plugin.
*   **Reusability:** Modules can be reused across multiple projects, reducing code duplication and development time.

The plugin utilizes a Service Locator pattern to manage dependencies and provide a central registry for accessing plugin services. This pattern promotes loose coupling and makes the code more flexible and testable.

## 4. Future Expansion and Features

The Data Machine plugin has significant potential for future expansion and the addition of new features. Some ideas for future development include:

*   **More Data Input Handlers:**
    *   Database Integration: Connect to various databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.) to import data.
    *   Web Scraping: Scrape data from websites using custom web scraping tools.
*   **More Data Processing Options:**
    *   Custom Code: Allow users to write custom PHP code to process and transform data.
    *   Data Validation: Implement data validation rules to ensure data quality and consistency.
*   **More Data Output Handlers:**
    *   Email: Send processed data via email.
    *   Other Social Media Platforms: Integrate with other social media platforms, such as Facebook, LinkedIn, and Mastodon.
*   **Improved Scheduling Options:**
    *   More Granular Control: Provide more granular control over scheduling, such as the ability to specify specific days of the week or times of day.
    *   Event-Based Scheduling: Trigger data collection and processing based on specific events, such as a new post being published or a file being uploaded.
*   **Enhanced User Interface and User Experience:**
    *   Drag-and-Drop Interface: Provide a drag-and-drop interface for creating and configuring data pipelines.
    *   Visual Data Mapping: Allow users to visually map data fields from the source to the destination.
    *   Real-time Monitoring: Provide real-time monitoring of data collection and processing tasks.

## 5. Known Issues and Feature Requests

### 5.1. Known Issues

1.  **Output Type Config Reset Issue:** When creating a new module, the output type configuration does not reset. This causes the settings from the previously selected module's output type to autofill, which is particularly problematic for remote locations and state management.
2.  **Custom Taxonomies Loading Issue:** When creating a new module, custom taxonomies do not automatically load after a post type is selected. Users must save and refresh the page to see and select custom taxonomies. This is not the intended user experience.
3.  **Twitter OAuth Issue:** Twitter OAuth is currently not working and needs to be investigated and fixed.
4.  **Partial Settings Rework:** There is an ongoing, but incomplete, rework to move logic to the `/settings` directory. This rework might be changed or adjusted in the future.

### 5.2. Feature Requests

1.  **Reddit Source - Multiple Images:** The Reddit source should be enhanced to pull multiple images from a Reddit post, if available. At least the first image should be processed, and ideally, users should be able to select which images to use.
2.  **Subreddit Keyword Filtering:** Implement keyword filtering for the subreddit input to allow users to filter posts based on keywords in the title or selftext, similar to the filtering available for REST and RSS inputs. This would allow for more targeted data collection from Reddit.
3.  **Instagram Scraper:** Develop an Instagram scraper input handler to collect data from Instagram.

## 6. Naming Convention Updates

The following admin page slugs, file, and class naming conventions are proposed to be updated for better clarity and consistency.

### 6.1. Admin Page Slugs

The admin page slug "Settings" will be changed to `module-config`.
The admin page slug "Project Dashboard" will be changed to `project-management`.
The admin page slug "Main Admin Page" will be changed to `run-single-module`.

### 6.2. File and Class Names

The file `admin/templates/settings-page.php` will be renamed to `admin/templates/module-config-page.php`. Corresponding classes, such as `class-data-machine-admin-settings-page.php`, should be renamed to `class-data-machine-admin-module-config-page.php`.
The file `admin/templates/project-dashboard-page.php` will be renamed to `admin/templates/project-management-page.php`. Corresponding classes, such as `class-data-machine-admin-project-dashboard-page.php`, should be renamed to `class-data-machine-admin-project-management-page.php`.
The file `admin/templates/main-admin-page.php` will be renamed to `admin/templates/run-single-module-page.php`. Corresponding classes, such as `class-data-machine-admin-main-admin-page.php`, should be renamed to `class-data-machine-admin-run-single-module-page.php`.

### 6.3. Directory Names

There are currently no plans to rename any directories.

## 7. Conclusion
