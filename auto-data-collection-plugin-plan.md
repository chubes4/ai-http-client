PLUGIN CORRECTLY ACHIEVES ITS BASIC FUNCTIONALITY

However, we have some potential improvements to note

1. Make the whole thing a 1 click process from processing to finalized json without the need for manual api requests after the first one

2. Change the boxes to not be code blocks but rather text areas and ensure that the copy to clipboard button works properly 

3. Add image processing to the available use cases

4. Make the language slightly more generic so it can be used for more than just JSON output but any kind of fact-checked output. 

5. Add batch processing so we can upload pdfs and press run

6. Integrate with the database to match pdfs uploaded to their corresponding json output for reference and association
