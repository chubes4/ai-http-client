# Receiver Step - Conceptual Architecture Demonstration

## Overview

The Receiver Step is currently a conceptual stub designed to demonstrate how new step types can be added to the Data Machine architecture. This step serves as an example of the plugin's extensible step system and filter-based registration pattern.

## Current Status

**Non-Functional**: This step is intentionally stubbed and will return `false` when executed. It exists purely to showcase the architectural patterns used throughout the system.

## Architecture Demonstration

The Receiver Step follows the same self-registration pattern as all other steps in the system:

1. **Step Class**: `ReceiverStep.php` - Implements the standard step interface
2. **Filter Registration**: Uses `dm_get_steps` filter for self-registration
3. **Handler Framework**: Designed to support multiple receiver handlers (webhooks, APIs, etc.)
4. **DataPacket Integration**: Follows the same data flow patterns as input/output steps

## Future Development

This step is planned to be fully implemented with:
- Webhook handlers for external service integrations
- API polling handlers for services without webhook support
- Real-time data reception capabilities
- Support for various authentication and verification methods

## For Developers

If you're looking to understand how to add new step types to Data Machine, the Receiver Step demonstrates:

- How steps self-register via filters
- The standard step interface and execution pattern
- Integration with the DataPacket system
- How handlers can be organized within step directories

The receiver architecture shows how the plugin's filter-based system enables unlimited extensibility while maintaining clean separation of concerns.

## Implementation Notes

When this step is eventually implemented, it will:
- Follow the same handler organization pattern as input/output steps
- Use parameter-based filter discovery for handler registration
- Support the same authentication and settings patterns as other handlers
- Integrate seamlessly with the existing Pipeline+Flow architecture

This stub serves as both a placeholder and a reference implementation for the step architecture patterns used throughout Data Machine.
